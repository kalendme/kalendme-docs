}
```

Used to describe a user's or an event's week availability. 0 through 6 represent the days of the week starting on sunday. All times are represented in local time to the user's configured time zone.

## Custom Question

```json
{
  "id": "3656475289d4aecd03804ec4d6045953", // An ID of your choosing to map to your system
  "order": 0,
  "question": "Whats your phone number?"
}
```

Used for specific user event types as questions for guests to fill out. They have an id, order in which to display to the user and the question itself.

## Event Location

```json
{
  "type": "phone", // Other types can be `online`, `zoom`, `inPerson`, `other`
  "value": "+1234567656324",
  "callDirection": "receive" // Only applicable to `phone` type locations. Valid values are: `make`/`receive`
}
```

Used to configure an event's location, can be used to pre-create links with these settings and also at the time of creating an event. Types are:

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| online   | The event will be created with an auto generated link for videoconferencing. Depending on your calendar provider this can be a Google Meet or a Microsoft Teams link. Value is not needed, since links are autogenerated.   |
| inPerson | The event will be in person at a physical location. You need to pass in a `value` specifying the address or place.                                                                                                          |
| zoom     | The event will be created with an auto generated Zoom link. The user must first have linked their Zoom account to their KalendMe account in integrations.                                                                   |
| phone    | The event will be a phone call. It must include a `callDirection` property indicating: `make` if the host will make a call, or `receive` if the host will receive a call. The value property then becomes the phone number. |
| other    | The event will be created with any special instructions you might want to be included under the value field                                                                                                                 |

## Event Padding

```json
{
  "before": 0,
  "after": 180
}
```

Used to specify if an event needs time padding before and/or after to be scheduled. Must be numbers in minutes of the padding needed and values can be anywhere between 0 and 180.
